It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it. It is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. The cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away. The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs. The story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king. The story also teaches cause and effect relationships. The pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.

Nicholas,"This is one of those books that purports to be about something, and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated. The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world. For the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do).

Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.","So awesome, but why no guide for A Link Between Worlds?",1385683200,0

I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!",Almost perfect guide set!,1385510400,1

When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary ""Time Compression"" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.

She's miserable because she misses Chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . . Well, it's an old story. Meanwhile, Chee is agonizing about her being gone, but doesn't want to pick up the phone and call her or go to see her because she might tell him to get lost or . . . Yeah, an old story.

Well, not quite. Getting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as Hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another. It would seem that he heard about how the ""pig"" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story. It certainly is the centerpiece of this story. Oh, that and a hit man who . . . Mustn't give that away either. For all its seeming shortcomings, The Sinister Pig provides bits of Leaphorn and Chee for diehard Hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of New Mexico to ponder.

It's certainly different, in important respects, from his other mysteries set in the Four Corners region. Primarily, it lacks the anthropological focus that's helped to make Hillerman's mysteries so unique and enjoyable over the years. The Native American cultures, which provide surprising depth to the characters as they negotiate their identities up against their traditions, and which also establish the cosmic setting in which the events of the novel are understood, are only hinted at in the novel. Not even the title is drawn from Native American mythology; it's a term borrowed from the oiling industry. So, there's no doubt that a large part of the formula that has produced Hillerman's success is lacking. That's worth knowing going into the book. But that said, I still enjoyed The Sinister Pig, just for different reasons than normal. The book is pretty well-plotted, as is usual for Hillerman. I've really thought that some of the the complaints against the plot I've read (i.e. having a good idea of the who masterminded the crime early on) were oversold, since those elements tend to appear in other Hillerman novels. The Sinister Pig's plot, though not as complex as always, is perfectly sensible and features a fine red herring. Mainly, though, I enjoyed the book because the rest of the series has taught me to admire and care for Hillerman's characters, especially for Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito here, and The Sinister Pig features important progress for them. That's the main thing that's different about The Sinister Pig. Hillerman has always used anthropology and myth to augment and enrich the mysteries, and that's gotten him his audience. Here, however, he'a a little more traditional, using simple romance, instead, as the special extra ingredient. That switch will leave many Hillerman fans less satisfied with this volume, and The Sinister Pig is also not the place to begin reading Hillerman. But I certainly thought it was fine for a change. I enjoyed it as a solid and light little mystery that also brought about some pleasant developments for two of my favorite characters.",Enjoyable...But for Different Reasons than Usual,1309651200,1

Morrison,"I, like many of the other reviewers here, am a long standing fan of Tony Hillerman's mysteries featuring Joe ""The Legendary Lieutenant"" Leaphorn and Jim Chee. I, also like many other reviewers, found __THE SINISTER PIG__ to be a compelling mystery. It carries through many themes from earlier Hillerman mysteries: We have Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, who is in love with Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito, formerly of the Tribal Police, but now with the Border Patrol. Chee is afraid to tell her of his feelings for fear of rejection. We have the aforementioned Bernadette Manuuelito who is in love with Jim Chee, but also is afraid to express her love due to the same fear. We have the now retired ""legendary Lieutenant"" with his ever-present maps and his analytical mind. It's always a pleasure to meet these three again. We have a powerful businessman/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way. We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man. Throw all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things. Well, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels. In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites. I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery. This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.

This time out, the story is plot-driven and largely takes place off the Four Corners Navajo reservation. Much time is spent on the ""guest star"" characters and not so much on our old friends. Thus, there is a thinness to this book despite a plot that starts off ambitiously snuffling up Washington corruption, post 9-11 paranoia, corrupt CEOs, drug smuggling, and other zeitgeist. The good news is, those who have read earlier entries in the series will be amused to find all of the other regulars finally losing patience with Jim Chee's romantic klutziness and variously taking him aside and essentially saying, look here, the time has come to get on with things. Also, Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy. There is a great scene where the FBI, New Mexico State Police, Bureau of Land Management, DEA, and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security, insisting on authority over everything and everybody.

Usually he obliges by adding to my small store of knowledge about the southwest or Navajo life. This time the additions, and there were some, were very small. Hillerman needs to get back into Chee or Leaphorn and then write a story. This is when he is at his best - but he is still very good.",A Pig is a Pig,1062806400,1

But two points define a line, and ""The Sinister Pig"" plots Mr. Hillerman's career straight down. In the corporate world you sometimes see a luminary from an earlier era who is ""RIP"" -- retired in place -- just going through the motions, living on past glories and collecting the big bucks for his reputation, not his current work. Sadly, this describes Tony Hillerman, who has decided to stir around a few ashes, thow in a highly predictable conclusion, and call it a novel. I bet he's laughing at his readers all the way to the bank. As for the book itself, reviewers occasionally describe a film as ""OK for a 10-minute sketch on SNL, but not a 90-minute feature."" That's Sinister Pig for you: interesting premise but almost no plot or character development (call central casting for all the stereotypes), no suspense (you know from the start who's really a bad guy and who's really not), and the shallowest of literary style (like Wailing Wind, everyone is constantly ""grinning"" at everyone else). The initial plot device, investigating diversion of Indian royalty payments, is both interesting and topical -- it's really happening -- but couldn't lead to a facile wrap-up in a mere 224 pages, so Mr. Hillerman switches to just another standard contraband tale. Rest assured, the good guys prosper, the bad guys pay, and the bad guys who are really good guys ... well, what do you expect? I did like the little polemics on stealing of Indian royalties, the vested interest of both narcos and narcs in keeping the ""War on Drugs"" going full steam, and the pervasiveness of corruption in high office, but they weren't enough to salvage an otherwise trivial work. If Mr. Hillerman hasn't retired completely, I'll wait until his next book is available in the public domain before reading it.","Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice ...",1055462400,1

My favorites are Dance Hall of the Dead and Skinwalkers. The Sinister Pig, simply put, is an awful book, and is not even close to the level Hillerman has set for himself. Much of the action takes place on airplanes and in limousines, and next to nothing occurs anywhere close to the Navajo reservation. Hillerman tries to introduce the flavor of the New Mexico/Mexico border region, but his descriptions do not even come close to the standard he set for the Four Corners area. Had I not been to this area many times myself (I grew up in Arizona) I wouldn't be able to distinguish the border region from Kentucky. Finally, the subtlety and grace of earlier Hillerman character interaction -- Leaphorn and Emma, Chee and Mary Landon, and so on -- has been blown away by a sudden urge by Hillerman to make everything explicit. Yes, Tony, we know Chee loves Bernie and Bernie loves Chee -- why do you have to pound it in to us in every single scene? This book was, simply put, painful to read, and I wouldn't have finished it at all were I not such a big Hillerman fan. If you are new to Hillerman, please please please do not begin with this poor work. And if you haven't read every Hillerman novel, probably multiple times, my advice is to put this one aside and go back to those books you haven't read, or haven't read in a while. I really wonder, seriously, if Hillerman farmed this out to some ghost writer -- it really has the feel of some poor shmuck trying to mimic Hillerman's characters....... it's sad, because I had really hoped that Tony had one or two good novels still left in him, but if The Sinister Pig is any indication, he doesn't.

It then brings Jim Chee in, them switches to Bernie Manuelito far from home and eventually in enters Joe Leaphorn with his professor friend. And eventually even Cowboy Dashee (?) enteres the story. Its like a gathering of old friends. It even has a sympathic hitman. I agree with most all of the criticism of this book and I don't care. A few years ago, Mr. Hillerman had a case of cancer and didn't write anything for a while. I guess I count every book after that a bonus book. As you can tell, this is not an objective review.

This time, it's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions, not the least to the very center of America itself, Washington D.C. Hillerman's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation. The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade, massive fraud by oil and gas organizations, and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border. Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they're reading from a daily newspaper (lately described as ""America's newest fiction form!"") editorial page. Still, the issues he present couldn't be more relevant. Granted, he takes care of his established characters. The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles: his relationship with Bernie, his responsibility to his native culture, and his loyalty to his job. Hillerman has no problem with any of this, yet ""The Sinister Pig"" seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author.

One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this. The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.,Hardly Functions,1338422400,0

I bought it in 1998 or so because I had played and loved Mega Man 3 for the Nintendo NES System - Video Game Console when I was young. This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.",My Favorite Game or All Time,1209859200,1

His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh. The Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between. The story of a young man trying to get up out of the hood, is one that's familiar with a lot of people. The struggle is real and that's probably why his music has resonated with so many folks from all corners of the world. Rap music may have gone through an epiphanous phase during the mid nineties through to ot-five. Slim coming in during the beginning and making it all the way through to the end without plastic surgery, heavy jail time or an over-dose. He may have made it through some dark times in order to tell us about it all years from now. This is an album that absolutely must be listened to as it encapsulates the last decade very well. ... ...","It's hard being young, from the slums, eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your next meal is coming from ...",1225065600,0

Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements. Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail. although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1. And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system. Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay. You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground. Which was improved in later Tekkens. And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times. The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken. Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves. I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process. Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic. Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends. Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?). This is a personal favorite of mines. But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.

Jongeling,"While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started. On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.",The building block of the Tekken series,1339200000,0

I like the concept, the puzzle solving and exploration. I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business.

Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES. ""Tomb Raider"" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with. Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol. Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform. Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut. The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture. Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy. Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants. All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride. Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills. There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden ""secrets,"" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous ""medi-paks."" Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.

1456,5,FALSE,"09 03, 2002",A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000006RGS,Busy Body,"So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase ""girl power"", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally.

Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master. Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring. Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II. Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games. The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection. Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation. And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value. But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.",Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired,986947200,1

WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead",Boring Game!,1400716800,0
1603,1,FALSE,"07 13, 2006",A2582KMXLK2P06,B000007NJC,Bryan,"I *hate* this game. Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me. The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares? It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life. Who cares? When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool. Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level. A whole new level of crap. You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same. Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there? That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games. For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc. Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism. I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game. A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it. And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago. It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game). Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis. Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome. Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong. Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach. It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing. After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened. Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind. Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!) Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is. After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly. Painfully slow, in fact. Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race. Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game. To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed. Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular ""create a wrestler"" mode. But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option. It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it. It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away. No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began. After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.",the absolute low point,1152748800,0

This story, and various versions of it, have been around a long, long time and the message it holds is as pertinent today as it was when this story was first conceived. While Watty Piper in most generally given credit for the writing of this wonderful little book, the story was actually first conceived in 1906 under the title Thinking One Can, and was meant to be a Sunday School Story. It was later published under the title of The Pony Engine, in 1920. After morphing through several versions and several titles, it was finally published in 1930 by Watty piper which was a pseudonym for the publisher. Since that time this little and wonderful story had continued to change in detail and even films have been made. The message throughout the years though has remained the same. Now this newest version, the one being reviewed here is indeed different than the original and the story has been snipped and changed here and there and the art work is most certainly different. Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to such works and normally I would go into a rant at this point in my review. Not so in this case.

The game is good, perhaps a little disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed).

But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly. Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake. The trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute: 1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon. 2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot. 3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together. 4. Allow to cool. 5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers. Don't take my word for it though.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made. 989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made. The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better. The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play. Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car. Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck. They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies. Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same. The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme. I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game. I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings. This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles. Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy. The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game. The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play. Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game. The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages. Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava. Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo. None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think. Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even. When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again. When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me. What programmer would add that in. It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating. When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time. The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague. The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game. the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful. The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful. All in All it is the worst game in the series.

Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the ""Z"" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that ""PRETTY MUCH"" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select ""Restart"" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game. Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.","The best snowboarding game, hands down.",975801600,0

It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: ""IRC W32 Tibick Activity"". Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to ""Final Fantasy VII"", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: ""Final Fantasy VII"" into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard. A page with three options will comeup. The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds. The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it. The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII. That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds. Thast one will automatically go to the computer's email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there. Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of ""Final Fantasy VII"" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about ""IRC W32 Tibick Activity"" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems. That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well. Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well. I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.

She has since passed away, however, the underlying message of the book about having confidence in oneself stuck. I think this theme of ""knowing you can do it"" is a value message for children to learn. I read through the story of the book and it had even more impact with the updated art. The images are original, powerful and really bring the story to life. I can see why they would appeal to children and the use of colors is amazing. I've read a few reviewers comments that the book is sexist. I didn't notice that the ""bad trains"" were a certain gender and the ""good trains"" another when I read it. However, I'm wondering if this just may be a coincidence. I have a hard time believing the author of a classic like this with such a good underlying positive message would do something like this on purpose. Ditto... for the editors who are watching out for problems like this. While I could be wrong, I think Watty Piper deserves the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she will be open to making some editorial changes to correct an apparent sexist slant in future editions. I also found the large format and prints in this book a value add. It is also printed on nice paper and lends itself to being used over and over. This format also makes it good for reading to small groups where the children will need to see the pictures from a distance. The toys seemed to be almost alive to me. The artwork was succesful in giving them some kind of personality. They seem more than just stuffed animals and I think this quality will appeal and endear them to children. The art is so captivating that it almost distracts me from the story. I have to admit I haven't read the classic version in a long time, but it seems to me there was more repetition of the core message in that version. If my memory is faulty, I think it would be an improvement to repeat the ""I think I can.... I know I can...."" theme more often. Overall, I don't think you can go wrong purchasing this classic book.

2376,5,FALSE,"08 24, 2010",A36UKFV79879MD,B00000DMAT,BX Lounger,"In the year 1997, Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo 64 by Rare, an unknown company and new 2nd party developer. Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered. REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers. REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode. If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends. Peace. :)",This is how all movie based video games should be made,1282608000,1

It told us that a ""dark time is approaching."" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought ""ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!"" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers! A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the ""Best Game of All Time"" by some, and the ""Most Overrated Game of All Time"" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play. Story: You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a ""Princess of Destiny,"" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself. Gameplay: To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it. Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that ""You can go wherever you want."" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it. Controls: They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process. Ocarina of Time introduced a ""Z-targeting system"" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it. Music: *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part. Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P Oh, and I'm sad to report that the ""OoT Commercial Music"" is not in this game... :( Replay Value: It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations. Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the ""Three Heart Challenge,"" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard). But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage. ______ If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome.

2551,2,FALSE,"08 12, 2013",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000DMAQ,Bryan,"Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining. It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease. All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun. This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design. I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time. The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments. Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie. But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time? If you think ""That's what ALL platformers do!"" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks. The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges. I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling. These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect. Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts. You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about. Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me. The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be. I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming. It's mind-boggling. They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie. The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself. Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group. It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers. Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself ""Is it worth my time to return here again?""",banjo kapooie,1376265600,0

I have looked at flatware sets at Walmart, Target and Costco and none of them pass the 'bending' test quite as well. When I tried to bend the fork tines on these at the store they held up way better than any other sets I have compared them too, even the other more expensive sets at Ikea! Also, I believe them to be quite durable because the cafeteria at our local Ikea actually uses the Dragon set as their flatware so you can pretty easily see how they hold up to ware and tare, which seems to be quite well! The new set is pretty shiny but the utensils in the cafeteria seem to have dulled a bit, although I am sure they go through some heavy washing pretty frequently. I would say the only thing I don't like about these is that the fork tines are not long enough to satisfy me, which is the only reason I haven't bought these yet despite my belief that they are of good quality.

There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword! Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon. The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get) Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn't bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious ""Mask of Truth"". Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up ""Majoras' Mask"". But of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn't bother to complete, but completing it does have it's merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game. The bosses are great. I won't go into great detail, but I've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it. The temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning. It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple, and the open courtyard. The music is top-notch even by today's standards. Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece. There is even a sweet element of sadness in Link's lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time. The ability to customize adult Link's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.

First published in 1885, Stevenson's marvellous collection of children's poetry has never gone out of print, and remains near the top of numerous ""best book's for childen"" lists. For example, Maurice Sendak, when asked to list books that he thought every child should have the opportunity to read, named this collection first. Harold Bloom, renowned literary critic (he has received more major awards from his peers than any other) and author of the thought-provoking and controversial ""The Western Canon"", included ACGoV in the list he furnished in response to an interviewer's request for a ""Western Canon, Jr"". Among the homeschooling set, everyone from ""Unschoolers"" to ""Classical Christian Educators"" recommend it.(It""s on the Classical Christian Support Loop's ""1000 Good Books List""). The Chronical Books edition, containing all 64 of the poems that appeared in the original 1885 edition, is lavishly illustrated with more than a hundred pictures, many of them full page, by several of the most distinguished children's book illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th century. The book is well laid out, with a pleasing juxtaposition of art and text, and printed on high-quality paper. It was named one of the ""Top Ten Picturebooks of the Year"" by Redbook, was an American Bookseller ""Pick of the Lists"" in 1989, and was given a starred review in Booklist. Stevenson perfectly captures the child's world of sunshine, stars, dreams, toy boats, swings, apple tarts, fairies, flowers, and far-away places in simple, evocative language which remains just as accessable for today's children as it was for their grandparents. And I can think of only one poem that might offend modern ""Politically Correct"" sensibilities: ""Foreign Children"", wherein the speaker imagines asking various nationalities' children ""O! don't you wish that you were me!"" I guess the historical and socio-cultural context of this poem could be discussed with your child if you were so inclined.

Writing them is a true art and Robert Louis Stevenson is able to perfect this art by remembering his own childhood. These poems were written between 1881 and 1884.

The paintings are impressions of color and light and show children and a few animals on beautiful canvases of cities, gardens, meadows and seas. The poems are about flying kites, cows which give cream to enjoy with apple-tart, flowers where fairies live, children sitting in the warm sun, children on a swing, children playing with toy boats and children playing in gardens who will never grow up as they are frozen in time in the beautiful pictures.

The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played. It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week. Somehow it just wouldn't die, no matter how hard we tried. At first, it just seemed so standard and bland. Playing muliplayer for the first time, I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level. soon, somehow, something clicked, and me and my friends ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight. Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session, we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me. Thus we coined the ""God"" mode, and we played this variant to death in the coming months. It didn't end there. We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches. We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen, LAN-type mode, covering up other player's screens so we wouldn't know where the other players were. We playedthe Team mode constantly, refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship. Fed up with auto-aiming, we turned it off and further honed our skills. I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep. Proximity mines soon became an addiction. We pushed the game to its limits, learning that we could move the ammo boxes, shields, and guns around by shooting them, thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games. We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that weren't intended for the final version, as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players. We discovered a code that turned one player invisible, and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen. Basically, it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities. It was a revolution for first-person shooters, and so many have overlooked this fact. It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts, over 20 weapons to choose from, realistic glass, shooting out of lights, and bullet holes, and for its time fairly revolutionary AI. All in all, it was an experience that defined video games for me, and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experience.",A complete revolution,1062460800,1

It launches out a little ball, and it goes straight for the enemies head. When it gets there, it starts sucking and draining blood form their head, then, after 5 second, it explodes, and takes the enemies head with it), my personal favorite, the Razor Wind (a shield with sharp edges on it. You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it's path, then come right back to you. It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at; the head, the legs, and the arms), and another physical weapon, the War Blade. The name says it all.

However when I played it one player I hated it. I thought it was too slow and real dodgy. But that was before I actually sat down and gave it a real go. And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better. To do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost. Once I had learned that it plays a lot faster. Overall, the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous SNES version. But it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version. But don't get me wrong, it is great for playing with friends, but it is a different feel from the original. In my opinion the best Mario Kart out is the GBA version because it is the SNES version with more tracks! (the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own. This version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons. They should have had more racers to choose from. And I miss my favourite driver the little Koopa Trooper, instead he's been taken out to make way for a slower Wario. But once I'd mastered that thing to take corners with, it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc. Overall, I give the one-player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4. Cons: Not enough tracks and courses. Once you've mastered the courses on 150cc, there is no further challenges for you in single player mode. - Not enough drivers to choose. - The sound effects can be very annoying after a while (like Toads Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa sound) - No way to turn the objects off (like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse... it is really unfair sometimes)",Mommamia,1121817600,0

Heck, the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot. Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one. Wide the whole way with walls all around. Too darn easy. However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting. Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway. It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers. Plus I really like the game's ending. There is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode. It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again. It usually takes away any hope of recovery. The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode. You can race a ghost of yourself after you've already completed the course.

As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N64 days, it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it's era. The sound is moderate, but sound isn't a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game. A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit, this game was certainly watched before it's release date, as it stormed into the N64 world and took many fans (as you can see from it's very high review in many chances) right away. It was considered as a very high class game then, and now too. Many of the N64 owners today have one in their hands, and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs. This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in. The size of a typical game back then, but with the technical advancements of some of the games today. The graphics are very good, as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly. The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time. The sound is entertaining for a while, and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses, showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts. The gameplay is also great. You may pick one of 8 characters to race with. On a small go - cart, you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first. There are many modes. You can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode, where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points. A vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 (or 3) in a single race. There is also a battle mode, which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins. The items in the game play a big part. Some will boost your speed, while some are used to slow down enemies. Some steal enemies items, and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible. Most of the however, are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down. In battle, it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy. The characters are the typical mario game characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, DK, and Bowser.

Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up. Mike London, 9-9-2012 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This commentary on ""Ocarina of Time"" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999. I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it. Mike London, November 3, 2007 Article 1: Does ""Zelda 64"" really live up to all the hype? [Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT. Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best? Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance? Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!] The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history. In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet. There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry. Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage. Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie. And they have one thing in common. They're both eye candy. But how do they hold up to the rest of the series? In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie. But what about OoT you ask? How can I defame such an instant classic? One reason mainly. In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular. Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon. Ah, the last dungeon. Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda. That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon. It was truly a great dungeon. Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version. What have we here? A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda! Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon. Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way! Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd. But guess what! No end dungeon! In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II). You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish. Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII). That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon? No where to be found here. Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol. So that offence is not to serious. And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour. After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64. So cool! Link in a 3D adventure. About time too. Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96. Of course, I bought the game. And of course, I beat it. It is an excellent game. Truly it is one of the great classics. But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past. The end dungeon absolutely sucked. That is my only disappointment with that game. As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower. I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past. [Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this] What did we get? Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers. What did we have to do? Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway. And what did I get? A great disappointment. Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible. The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable. That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series. [Spoiler Finished] Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game. I have to disagree. Don't get me wrong. It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64. It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right. But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game. LTTP is huge. It fully utilized the SNES technology. It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever. That's one more than the original has. (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.) After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon. There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also. Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite. But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT? My two chief complaints are these: 1. Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above). 2. Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld. All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld. But what have we in OoT? A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field. Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen. For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem. Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda. Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme. They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age. That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series. And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT? The Overworld them from the original LoZ! I couldn't believe they did that! Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden. Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too. Just a thought. Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game. Quite the opposite, really. It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series. (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article). But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance. Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above. It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it. It provides a lot of enjoyment. But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype? I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually. [May 9, 1999. An article originally written for NintendoLand.com. I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2). It will have to be edited. Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.] . . . . . -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Article 2: [Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.] Zelda 64 a Remake? [Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!] After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP. Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing. In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple. Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson! Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; ) The real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review: A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 64 1. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped. 2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion. 3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game. 4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game. When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown. 5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World. 6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same. 7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle. 8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower. 9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower. 10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower. 11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals. 12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker. 13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also. 14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do. 15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall. 16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos. As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company. *In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.",Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?,1193961600,0

Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest. This is a place where people never grow up and aren't allowed to leave the forest. They're called the Kokiri. But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule? If you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special.

The lighting rivals that of a Playstation 2 or Xbox or Game Cube. The sound is terrific. Each different sound effect was done in detail.

The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Link's footsteps are done perfectly.

Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you don't already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now.

But then I realized ""oh yeah there's more to this, isn't there?"" And that's when the fun started. Graphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that ""wow factor"", like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes. Sound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying ""Hey!"" and an occasional ""Hello"" from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music. One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play, such as Song of Storms, Zelda's Lullaby and Song of Time, plus general area music. Although the overworld music isn't like what it was on Link to the Past, it's still great. Story: The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman. Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there. Even though it can be a quite simple story, it's just a huge epic story that kept me interested. Gameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour.

The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it. What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did. Much of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal. The gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples). In brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.",May Very Well Be The Finest Video Game Ever Released.,1018051200,1

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser. You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man. Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience. As with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game. They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part. There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with. Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots. The controls are wonderfully intuitive. Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself. The Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it. You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential. In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task. Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game. As I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game. They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier. One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows! Later in the game, you will be glad you did. Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars. They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game. Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword. Don't say I didn't warn you... Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one. The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule. These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on. All in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect. Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan. But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!

Karp's excellent book covers a broad range of subjects in modern molecular and cellular biology, in a compact form that still manages to convey the experimental process. The text is extremely readable, and is organized to be flexible for many different types of courses.

This what I learned from owning this Cuisinart Blender! The only good thing I can say about this is I like the soft touch buttons and it blends just as good as other blenders when the parts are still intact. Within a couple of months of owning it, I smelled burnt plastic when the plastic gears on the blade stripped away suddenly. NOT GOOD! For a person who makes fruit smoothies or ice coffee daily, Cuisinart blender is a bad investment. I recommend an Oster Blender.........they last me for so many years and I replace the blade when it gets dull. My current blade is 4 years old. For those expecting to blender bigger jobs, like chunks vegetables, cooked beans, to make soups, I don't recommend these smaller blenders........get a bigger professional blenders that have the power and capacity to handle big jobs. For what you pay for this expensive blender, they should make the gear parts all metal drive just like the Oster, which costs less!",Avoid this over priced blender!,1417651200,0

It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests. It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny. He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule. Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree. He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him. Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest. The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule. But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones. Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him. But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water. Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce. Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up. Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions. He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit. But the game. It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!",A Game For Masters,994464000,1
